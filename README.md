# Flast Card + React Native app example
===

This is an example [Udacity Flash Card] backed [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app for the mobile flash card.

## Setup

Run the yarn command to download the needed libraries

c:\yarn

## Start


Run your app in development mode.

c:\yarn start

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

## Tested

This was only tested on an android device
